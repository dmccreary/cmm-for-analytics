For example, if they run a single local business that does hands-on services they would get a low risk score.</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>Certainly! Creating a set of multiple-choice questions with a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 is low risk and 5 is high risk) can effectively assess an organization's vulnerability to competition from generative AI. Here are 10 questions to help gauge this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>How much does your organization rely on creating original content (text, images, videos, etc.)?</p> <ol> <li>Not at all (1)</li> <li>Slightly (2)</li> <li>Moderately (3)</li> <li>Highly (4)</li> <li>Exclusively (5)</li> <li> <p>To what extent do software and digital technology drive your core business processes?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not applicable (1)</p> </li> <li>Marginally (2)</li> <li>To a fair extent (3)</li> <li>Significantly (4)</li> <li>Completely (5)</li> <li> <p>How critical is personalized customer interaction and service to your business model?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not critical (5)</p> </li> <li>Slightly important (4)</li> <li>Moderately important (3)</li> <li>Very important (2)</li> <li>Absolutely essential (1)</li> <li> <p>How much does your business depend on creative design (fashion, graphics, product design, etc.)?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not at all (1)</p> </li> <li>Slightly (2)</li> <li>Moderately (3)</li> <li>Highly (4)</li> <li>Entirely (5)</li> <li> <p>How important is face-to-face interaction in your service delivery?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not important (5)</p> </li> <li>Slightly important (4)</li> <li>Moderately important (3)</li> <li>Very important (2)</li> <li>Essential (1)</li> <li> <p>To what degree does your organization rely on data analysis and predictive modeling?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not at all (1)</p> </li> <li>Rarely (2)</li> <li>Sometimes (3)</li> <li>Often (4)</li> <li>Continuously (5)</li> <li> <p>How much does your organization depend on manual labor and physical tasks?</p> </li> <li> <p>Entirely (1)</p> </li> <li>Mostly (2)</li> <li>Equally with automated processes (3)</li> <li>Less than automated processes (4)</li> <li>Not at all (5)</li> <li> <p>How significant is the role of research and development in your organization?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not significant (1)</p> </li> <li>Slightly significant (2)</li> <li>Moderately significant (3)</li> <li>Very significant (4)</li> <li>Fundamental (5)</li> <li> <p>To what extent does your organization engage in marketing and advertising activities?</p> </li> <li> <p>Not at all (1)</p> </li> <li>Minimally (2)</li> <li>To some extent (3)</li> <li>Heavily (4)</li> <li>It's our core activity (5)</li> <li> <p>How much does your organization's success depend on in-person, localized services (like hospitality, local retail)?</p> </li> <li> <p>Entirely (1)</p> </li> <li>Mostly (2)</li> <li>Partially (3)</li> <li>Less so (4)</li> <li>Not at all (5)</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>Each question is designed to assess different aspects of an organization's operations and how they might be impacted by generative AI. The total score will help determine where they stand on the risk spectrum, with higher scores indicating greater potential risk from AI-driven competition.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"sims/vulnerability/#form-prompt","title":"Form Prompt","text":"<pre><code>Wow! that is perfect!

With all the focus on data privacy and regulations like GDPR, we know that there is clear legal issues for every bit of data you have about your customers.  Even their product search and web usage logs can provide information about your users, and in many countries that are part of the EU, not knowing you have data about your customers can cause billions of dollars in fines.</p> <p>What this tells us is that any company that gathers customer data needs to connect this data in a customer 360 database.

We often have a strong intuition about where an industry is going.  For example, I know that as graph databases become more popular, there will be new custom silicon that is optimized to perform graph query traversal at scale.   However, I am not so naive that I think I know when these chips will be available for production.  But the actual date is not as important as the direction to move your strategy.  IT strategies need to expect that CISC hardware will become obsolete for most scalable analytic workloads.</p>"},{"location":"quotes/#innovation-at-the-seams-of-technology","title":"Innovation at the Seams of Technology","text":"<p>Innovation occurs at the seams of technology. - David Canter</p> <p>The full version is:</p> <p>As a technology generalist, I have found that tremendous innovation occurs at the seams of technology domains.</p> <p>This quote came about when I was interviewing David Cantor for a blog I was writing on machine learning hardware benchmarking.

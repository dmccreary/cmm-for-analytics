# Microstrategies from Moving from L2 to L2

## Sample Prompt

```linenums="0"
I work at a medium-sized company (10,000 employees) 
that is at Capability Maturing Model (CMM) level 2 (Repeatable) 
with regard to our use of Generative AI (GenAI). 
We have a few pilot GenAI projects, but we would 
like to move to the next level of maturity (Defined).

Our focus now is to have clearly defined and documented processes.

The Defined level is characteristic of processes 
that create sets of defined and documented standard
peer reviewed processes established and subject to some
degree of improvement over time. These standard processes
are in place. The processes may not have been systematically
or repeatedly used - sufficient for the users to become
competent or the process to be validated in a range of
situations. This could be considered a developmental
stage - with use in a wider range of conditions and
user competence development the process can develop to
next level of maturity.

A microstrategy is a small step that we can do to move 
forward in a strategic direction. It can often be a 
simple survey, a contest, a seminar, a presentation, 
a laptop sticker, an award or recognition or a prize.

Please list 20 microstrategies we can use to move
from GenAI level 2 to GenAI level 3.

# Generative AI CMM Assessment

In this section we will learn how to use generative AI to create a web form you can use to do a simple placement on a 1-5 level of a capability maturity model (CMM).

## Sample Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a 10-question form that helps classify an organization on the right five step CMM level for
the use of generative AI.
Each question has a five answer multiple choice question.  The score of each question is assigned
a level of 1 to 5.  At the end of the form,
a score is tallied and the range should be a level from 1 to 5.
```

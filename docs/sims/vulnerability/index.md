## Sample High Vulnerability Prompt

```linenums="0"
I am a generative AI consultant.  Organizations ask
me what are the risks of generative AI allowing their
competitors to build new products with generative AI.
For example, I already know that organizations with knowledge workers,
software developers and organizations that create content
are vulnerable.  Can you please create a list of the 10
types of organizations that are most vulnerable to generative
AI based competition?
```

### ChatGPT Response

Certainly! When assessing the vulnerability of different 
types of organizations to competition enhanced by generative AI, 
it's crucial to consider how this technology can revolutionize 
product development, content creation, and various operational 
processes. Here's a list of 10 types of organizations that 
might be most vulnerable to such competition:

1.  **Content Creation and Media Companies**: Generative AI can produce high-quality written, visual, and audio content at a fraction of the time and cost, potentially outpacing traditional media and content production firms.

2.  **Software Development Firms**: With AI's ability to write and review code, develop algorithms, and automate testing, software development firms could face stiff competition from those leveraging AI more effectively.

3.  **Marketing and Advertising Agencies**: Generative AI can create compelling marketing content, personalized advertisements, and automate large parts of the creative process, potentially outpacing traditional agencies.

4.  **Educational Content Providers**: AI's ability to generate educational material, interactive learning experiences, and personalized learning paths can disrupt traditional educational content and e-learning platforms.

5.  **Legal Services and Consultancies**: AI can automate document review, legal research, and draft standard legal documents, challenging traditional legal and consultancy practices.

6.  **Fashion and Design Industries**: AI's ability to predict trends, design patterns, and even create entire collections can significantly impact traditional fashion and design firms.

7.  **Film and Entertainment Production Companies**: Generative AI can write scripts, create visual effects, and even generate music, posing a challenge to traditional production methods.

8.  **Publishing Houses**: With AI's ability to write books, articles, and other written content, traditional publishing might struggle to compete with AI-driven self-publishing platforms.

9.  **Research and Development Firms**: AI can accelerate the R&D process by simulating experiments, predicting outcomes, and analyzing data, potentially outpacing firms that rely on traditional R&D methods.

10.  **Retail and E-commerce Platforms**: Generative AI can personalize shopping experiences, predict consumer trends, and automate customer service, presenting a significant challenge to traditional retail models.

These types of organizations are particularly vulnerable because generative AI can either replicate or significantly enhance core aspects of their product or service offerings. This does not mean these industries will become obsolete, but rather that they will need to adapt and integrate AI technologies to stay competitive.

## Least Vulnerable Organization Types

### Prompt

```linenums="0"
That was Perfect! Can you now generate the same list for
the least vulnerable organization types? For example,
local restaurants, the local barber shop or the local
nail salon will not be impacted by new generative AI
companies and products.
```

### ChatGPT Response

Absolutely! While generative AI is reshaping many industries, there are certain types of organizations that are less vulnerable to the disruptions caused by this technology, often due to the personalized, localized, or highly specialized nature of their services. Here's a list of 10 types of organizations that are likely to be the least vulnerable to competition from generative AI:

1.  **Local Restaurants and Cafes**: The experience of dining out, with its emphasis on atmosphere, personal service, and local culinary specialties, is difficult to replicate with AI.

2.  **Local Personal Care Services**: This includes barber shops, beauty salons, and nail salons, where the personal touch, human interaction, and specific customer preferences are paramount.

3.  **Healthcare Providers**: While AI can assist in diagnostics and patient management, the direct patient care provided by doctors, nurses, and therapists relies heavily on human empathy and judgment.

4.  **Emergency Services**: Roles like firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians require real-time, on-the-ground decision making in unpredictable environments, which is challenging for AI to replicate.

5.  **Artisan and Craft Businesses**: Custom, handcrafted products made by artisans, like handmade jewelry, pottery, or bespoke tailoring, offer a level of uniqueness and human touch that AI cannot duplicate.

6.  **On-Site Construction and Repair Services**: The complexities of on-site work in construction, plumbing, electrical work, and home repair require human adaptability and problem-solving in varied environments.

7.  **Local Sports and Fitness Coaching**: Personalized training, sports coaching, and fitness instruction benefit from human interaction, motivation, and technique correction that are beyond the scope of AI.

8.  **Live Entertainment and Performance Arts**: Live theater, dance, music performances, and other forms of live entertainment rely on human talent, creativity, and interaction with the audience.

9.  **Childcare Services**: The nurturing, caregiving, and educational aspects of childcare are deeply rooted in human empathy and interaction, making them less susceptible to AI disruption.

10.  **Specialized Consulting Services**: Consultants providing expert advice in fields where deep, nuanced understanding of specific industries, cultures, or regulatory environments is required, remain less affected by AI.

These organizations are less vulnerable because their core value often lies in the human experience, personalization, and physical interaction -- aspects that are currently challenging for AI to fully replicate or replace. However, it's important to note that while these types of organizations might be less directly impacted by generative AI, they may still benefit from AI in terms of operational efficiencies, customer service improvements, and other supportive roles.

## Create a List of Multiple Choice Question

Could you now create a list of 10 multiple-choice questions that we could ask an organization to see where they fall on the risk spectrum? The responses should all have a scale 1 to 5 scale with 1 being low risk and 5 being high risk. We would add up all the question values to come up with a composite risk score. For example, if they run a single local business that does hands-on services they would get a low risk score.

Certainly! Creating a set of multiple-choice questions with a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 is low risk and 5 is high risk) can effectively assess an organization's vulnerability to competition from generative AI. Here are 10 questions to help gauge this:

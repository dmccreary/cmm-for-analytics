# CMM for Generative AI Simulations

How can we build intelligent agents that help
us create and refine our generative AI strategy?

One method is to use generative AI to build
simulations of your organization and see what
impact different strategies have on the survivability
of your organization.

Finding the right simulation initial parameters is key.
You can use the following forms to help set up
the initial conditions of your simulation:

1. [GenAI CMM Level Assessment Survey](./assessment/index.md)
2. [GenAI Organization Vulnerability Survey](./vulnerability/index.md)

From this dataset, we can then create the initial conditions of the simulation.

The simulation will use [Systems Thinking](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-systems-thinking/) and [Causal Loop Diagrams](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-systems-thinking/glossary/#causal-loop-diagrams) to look for [leverage points](https://dmccreary.github.io/graph-systems-thinking/glossary/#leverage-points)
that can move your organization up to different CMM levels with
the least amount of effort.

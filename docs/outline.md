# Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Analytics and Data Science

## 1. Initial (Chaotic)

- **Characteristics**: 
  - The organization is unpredictable, reactive, and lacks stable processes.
  - Data science projects are often one-offs, with minimal documentation or repeatability.

- **Metrics**:
  - Percentage of undocumented data science projects.
  - Lack of standardized tools and platforms.
  - Number of ad hoc requests versus planned projects.

- **Steps to Improve**:
  - Recognize the importance of data science maturity.
  - Invest in basic data science training.
  - Document ongoing projects and results.

## 2. Repeatable

- **Characteristics**: 
  - The organization can repeat previous successes because there are some basic processes in place, though they may not be strictly followed.

- **Metrics**:
  - Number of standardized processes implemented.
  - Percentage of projects with documented methodologies.
  - Number of recurring data issues or errors.

- **Steps to Improve**:
  - Develop and document standard data science processes.
  - Train teams on these processes.
  - Initiate basic version control and collaboration tools.

## 3. Defined

- **Characteristics**: 
  - Processes are documented, standardized, and integrated into the organization.
  - There's a consistent approach to data science projects.

- **Metrics**:
  - Percentage of data science staff trained on standard processes.
  - Consistency in tools and platforms used.
  - Time taken from project initiation to delivery.

- **Steps to Improve**:
  - Create a centralized repository for processes, tools, and methodologies.
  - Implement regular training and onboarding programs.
  - Adopt a consistent set of tools and platforms.

## 4. Managed

- **Characteristics**: 
  - The organization monitors and controls its processes using data.
  - There's an understanding of the quality and outcomes of data science projects.

- **Metrics**:
  - Number of projects meeting predefined success criteria.
  - Regularity of process audits and reviews.
  - Number of ongoing improvement initiatives.

- **Steps to Improve**:
  - Implement advanced data quality and validation checks.
  - Monitor projects in real-time to identify bottlenecks and areas of improvement.
  - Use metrics and feedback to refine processes continuously.

## 5. Optimizing

- **Characteristics**: 
  - Continuous process improvement is ingrained in the culture.
  - The organization is proactive and uses insights to drive further refinement and innovation in data science projects.

- **Metrics**:
  - Number of innovative data science projects launched.
  - Frequency of process enhancements based on feedback and learnings.
  - Level of automation in data processing and model deployment.

- **Steps to Improve**:
  - This is the highest level of maturity, so the focus is on maintaining this status and innovating. 
  - Foster a culture of continuous learning and exploration.
  - Regularly revisit and refine processes, always looking for efficiency gains and areas of innovation.
